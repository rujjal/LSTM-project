The dataset is made available by NASA Ames' Prognostics CoE. (https://data.nasa.gov/Aerospace/CMAPSS-Jet-Engine-Simulated-Data/ff5v-kuh6)

\ These are data collected during an engine degradation simulation, using the C-MAPSS simulator, acronym for "Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation", considered << high-fidelity system-level, designed to simulate nominal and engine failure degradation over a series of flights. >> The objective with which the dataset was created is to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of each engine. RUL is the number of flights left to the engine after the last datapoint recorded in the test dataset.
